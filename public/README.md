Static files here are served at the site root in both dev and production.

What’s included now:
- favicon.svg — used by modern browsers as the site icon.
- og.png — social preview image (1200x630). Already referenced in index.html.

Add for full branding:
- apple-touch-icon.png — 180x180 PNG for iOS home screen icon. Place it in this folder. The <link rel="apple-touch-icon"> tag is already present in index.html.

After deploying changes, force a social preview refresh:
